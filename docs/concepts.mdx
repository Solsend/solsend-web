# Concepts

There are two main concepts in Solsend - **channels** and **notifications**. **Channels** are like a pipe, in that, you send data through them, from one place to another. You can create a channel by interacting with our smart contract, and calling  `init_channel`. More on creating channels in [get started guide](/getting-started). 

Apart from channels, we have notifications. **Notifications** are the raw data you send, in a more serialized manner. Notifications are more similar to events, since you send or emit an event to raise awareness about some change. Notifications are sent within a channel, and they are also on-chain alongside channels. More on sending notifications in [get started guide](/getting-started).

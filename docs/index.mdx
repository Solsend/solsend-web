# Overview

Solsend is a decentralized real-time notification protocol built on Solana, for Solana. The founding
goal in mind for Solsend was to enable intra-chain communication between users, dApps and wallets.

Using the protocol, any smart contract, dApp, or even a backend service can send or consume 
on-chain notifications easily. To learn more about how Solsend works, the theory and the core 
concepts behind the protocol, check out [Concepts](/concepts), or you can
